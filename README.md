# 🏂 Force Analysis of Mogul Impact Using Multivariable Calculus and Physics

This analysis estimates the **force experienced by a skier** hitting a mogul on a World Cup-level course using physics and multivariable calculus concepts.

---

## 🧠 Concept: Impulse-Momentum Theorem

When a skier hits a mogul, their **vertical velocity changes rapidly**, producing a significant force. We apply the **impulse-momentum theorem**:

```
F = Δp / Δt = (m * Δv_z) / Δt
```

Where:

- `F` = Force in Newtons (N)  
- `m` = Skier's mass (kg)  
- `Δv_z` = Change in vertical velocity (m/s)  
- `Δt` = Time of contact with the mogul (s)

---

## 📐 Assumptions

| Variable      | Value   | Explanation                                  |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------------|
| `m`           | 75 kg   | Mass of an elite mogul skier                 |
| `Δv_z`        | 4 m/s   | Estimated vertical velocity change on impact |
| `Δt`          | 0.1 s   | Approximate contact time with a mogul        |

---

## ✅ Calculation

Using the impulse-momentum formula:

```
F = (75 kg * 4 m/s) / 0.1 s = 3000 N
```

---

## 🔍 Interpretation

- A force of **3,000 N** is equivalent to lifting **~300 kg** off the ground momentarily.
- This illustrates the extreme **athletic demands** of World Cup mogul skiing.
- Actual force values vary based on mogul shape, skier technique, and approach speed.

---

## 📌 Future Extensions

- Compare force profiles for different mogul sizes and skier speeds.
- Visualize 3D force vectors using multivariable gradients on the mogul surface.
- Simulate energy loss and restitution using physics-based modeling tools.
